//Building on your solutions from the previous exercises, write a function localGreet that takes a locale as input, and returns a greeting. The locale allows us to greet people from different countries differently also when they share the language, for example:*/



localGreet('en_US.UTF-8'); // 'Hey!'
localGreet('en_GB.UTF-8'); // 'Hello!'
localGreet('en_AU.UTF-8'); // 'Howdy!'
